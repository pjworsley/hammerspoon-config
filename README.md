# hammerspoon-config
Custom config files for macOS hammerspoon

##Caffeine
The simple caffeine example from http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/#simplemenubar but with pretty icons instead of text in the menu bar.

## Spotify menubar
Spotify now playing information on menubar with controls 'Play/Pause, Next, Previous and activate spotify window'. This is a basic form of the menubar item provided by the linux version of spotify that was omitted from the the macOS build.

The skip back functionality can be changed with the menu option 'Full skip back'. If this is checked, then when 'previous' is selected the previous song will be played (Default behaviour in this application). Otherwise the player will go to the start of the current song if over 2 seconds into the track - this is the default behaviour of spotify, but not this tool as pressing the menu bar twice is annoying.
